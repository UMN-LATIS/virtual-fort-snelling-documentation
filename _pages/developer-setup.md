## 1. Software Requirements

Before you begin development, please ensure that you have the following software versions installed. Try to stick as close to the listed versions as possible (but if that is not possible, endeavor to use newer versions rather than older versions).

### 1a. Git

Any recent version should work. I've been rolling with `2.30.1`.

You will need Git to clone the repository. Additionally, Unity uses Git under the hood to pull in some external packages.

### 1b. Blender

`2.83.5`

You can download this version from the [Blender Archive](https://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.83/).

### 1c. Houdini

`18.5.633 Education Edition`

You can download the installer directly from [SideFX](https://www.sidefx.com/download/daily-builds/?production=true&python3=true) website. You will need to contact [Colin McFadden](mailto:mailto:mcfa0086@umn.edu) for the login to the license server.

### 1d. Unity

`2020.3.16f1`

You can download this version directly from the [Unity Archive](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.16).
