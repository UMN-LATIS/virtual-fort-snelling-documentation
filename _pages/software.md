Before you begin development, please ensure that you have the following software versions installed. Try to stick as close to the listed versions as possible (but if that is not possible, endeavor to use newer versions rather than older versions).

### 1. Git

Any recent version should work. I've been rolling with `2.30.1`.

You will need Git to clone the repository. Additionally, Unity uses Git under the hood to pull in some external packages.

### 2. Blender

`2.83.5`

You can download this version from the [Blender Archive](https://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.83/).

TODO: what is Blender used for?

### 3. Houdini

`18.5.633 Education Edition`

You can download the installer directly from [SideFX](https://www.sidefx.com/download/daily-builds/?production=true&python3=true) website. You will need to contact [Colin McFadden](mailto:mailto:mcfa0086@umn.edu) for the login to the license server.

### 4. Unity

`2020.3.16f1`

You can download this version directly from the [Unity Archive](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.16).

### 5. Jekyll

Any recent version should work. I've been rolling with `4.2.0`.

You can install Jekyll through the command line via Homebrew on macOS.

This is only required to build the documentation locally. If you don't need or want to build the documentation, don't worry about installing this.
